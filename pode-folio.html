<h3> My personality </h3>
<b>  Growing up, i have always been an introvert.
    <br> When i go to the event, it's hard for me to introduce myself with other new people, so i just stick around with the ones i already know.
    <br> I don't have a social anxiety, and i do not want to develop one. I have also taken part in public speaking at my school to improve my speaking skills and not be nervous with other people.
    <br> I have given speech at many events at school, like parents day, I have also been in the school radio once to recite a poem.
